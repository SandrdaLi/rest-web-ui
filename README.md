# ReST-Web-UI
Framework to create descriptive web applications for REST/JSON type web services. All you need is a modern web browser -- and a web service somewhere.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this project:
    git clone https://github.com/ma-ha/rest-web-ui.git
2. Open the *html/index.html* in your web browser. <br>This generates an UI without a dynamic backend.
2. Open the *html/svc/layout/main/structure* in an editor and start there to modify it to your needs.

## Quick Start: Do More Complex Things
I run a Portal-as-a-Service site, where you can register for free and 
create intuitively more complex Web UIs more easily: http://mh-svr.de/portal
